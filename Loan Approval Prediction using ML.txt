Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

Built a binary classification model to predict whether a loan application should be approved or rejected using a Kaggle Loan dataset.

Implemented Logistic Regression as the primary algorithm and achieved strong performance by optimizing preprocessing and feature transformations.

Performed extensive data cleaning, handled missing values, and encoded categorical variables using OneHotEncoder; scaled numerical features for improved model performance.

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key drivers affecting loan approval, such as income level, credit history, loan amount, and employment status.

Split data into training and testing sets to ensure robust performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.

Serialized the trained model using Pickle (loan_model.pkl) for reuse and deployment.

Developed an interactive Streamlit web application allowing users to input applicant data and receive real-time loan approval predictions.

Created a clean and user-friendly interface for seamless user interaction and instant classification results.

Demonstrated an end-to-end ML workflow including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, serialization, and deployment.
